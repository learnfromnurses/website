                Cocaine usage exacerbates the usual circulatory changes that

              <h4>Treatment and <em>Management</em></h4>
              <p>
                ● <strong> Seek expert assistance </strong>- a professional knows more than
                anybody else. Seeking professional treatment from a doctor,
                licensed psychologist, psychiatrist, mental health worker, or
                counselor after admitting you have a problem and desire to
                conquer your addiction is a critical step on the road to
                recovery. They will be able to analyze your condition and, if
                required, propose other treatment alternatives. <br /><br />
                ● <strong> Look for a residential treatment facility</strong> - If outpatient
                counseling and treatment aren't enough, a residential treatment
                program will not only provide you with the support of your peers
                and counselors, but will also keep you away from any situations
                that can trigger you to use cocaine.
                <br /><br />
                ● <strong> Join groups that provide assistance </strong>- peer support
                organizations, such as Cocaine Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous,
                can provide a secure, comfortable environment for you to share
                your thoughts, feelings, and actions with others who are going
                through the same thing and can relate, whether in person or
                online. <br /><br />
                ● <strong>Medication</strong> - There are currently no FDA-approved medications
                for the treatment of cocaine use disorder or addiction. Certain
                antidepressants and stimulants, as well as other medications,
                may be administered to aid with cravings, withdrawal symptoms,
                or even to negate the positive effects of cocaine use.

                ● Mothers who are known to be using amphetamines are at
                increased risk for mental co-morbidity and worse obstetric
                outcomes, but their babies may go undetected since the
                indications of withdrawal are often less prominent than those
                seen in opiate-exposed newborns.

              <h4>Risk to the <em>Child</em></h4>
              <p>
                ● Infants exposed to amphetamines during pregnancy have been
                shown to suffer clefting, heart abnormalities, and fetal growth
                reduction impairments. Because exposed children may be at risk
                for long-term developmental and behavioral impairment, the
                authors advocate increasing the availability of
                early-intervention programs for affected children and their
                families.

              <h6>Amphetamines</h6>
              <h4>Treatment and <em>Management</em></h4>
              <p>
                The first step in treatment is acknowledging that there is a
                problem. Once you've decided that you want to do something about
                your drug usage, the next step is to seek assistance and
                assistance.
                <br />
                <strong> Counseling</strong> is used in treatment programs to help patients
                improve their behavior (talk therapy). The goal is to assist you
                in better understanding your behaviors and the reasons for your
                use of amphetamines. Involving family and friends throughout
                therapy might help you feel supported and prevent you from
                relapsing into substance abuse. <br />
                If you are experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms, you may be
                required to remain in a residential treatment facility. As you
                recuperate, your health and safety may be monitored in that
                facility. Amphetamine usage can be reduced by inhibiting the
                effects of amphetamines, however at this time, there is no
                medication that can assist with this.

                Pregnant women who have been discovered as marijuana users
                should be assigned for psychological therapy, detoxification,
                and psychiatric treatment. Neonates who have been exposed to
                marijuana must be tested for other substances and treated
                accordingly. Marijuana and tobacco use rarely require medical
                intervention. Prolonged exposure to medications like opioids may
                need a prolonged hospitalization and therapy of neonatal opioid
                withdrawal syndrome.

                A PCP overdose cannot be treated with any specific medications.
                Treatment is frequently adjusted to the individual's appearance.
                If a patient is aggressive, violent, confused, or delusional,
                sedative drugs (typically benzodiazepines) and restraints are
                frequently used. Until the person calms down, environmental
                stimuli should be maintained. This mainly involves turning off
                lights, reducing noise, and restricting visitors and medical
                workers to a bare minimum.
                <br />
                In order to administer some medications, the patient may have to
                be intubated if they are excessively hyperactive or anxious.
                After a person has been restrained, they can be administered
                intravenous fluids and activated charcoal, specifically when it
                is suspected that the person took the drug PCP orally. In
                instances of PCP overdose, activated charcoal has been shown to
                absorb PCP and reduce the risk of renal failure. Elevated body
                temperatures might necessitate the use of liquids and
                ventilation to cool them down.
                <br />
                The practitioners will keep an eye on the patient's vital signs
                and address any further symptoms that arise. Benzodiazepines can
                be used to manage seizure activity. Antipsychotic drugs may be
                utilized in certain circumstances if the patient's behavior is
                openly psychotic.

                Inhalants include several poisonous compounds which are harmful
                to both the mother and the child. It is thought that practically
                all inhalants penetrate the placenta and enter the baby's
                bloodstream. For this reason, it is crucial you cease utilizing
                inhalants during pregnancy.

                There are only a restricted number of effective treatments for
                drug abuse during pregnancy, and these treatments are mostly
                based on behavioral therapy techniques.
                <br />
                Prenatal alcohol consumption has been demonstrated to be reduced
                by brief treatments particularly those that make use of
                motivational interviewing techniques. A recent randomized study
                with a telephone-based short intervention indicated that this
                way of reducing prenatal drinking may yield benefits that are
                comparable to those obtained with an in-person intervention
                method.
                <br />
                Some further strategies to minimize prenatal drinking that have

              <h4>Risks to the <em>Mother</em></h4>
              <p>
                Because narcotics are usually injected through the use of shared
                needles, pregnancy complications of opiate-dependent women
                include the following:
                <br />
                According to <strong> Mayo Clinic (n.d.),</strong> Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is
                easily transmitted by infected blood-contaminated needles and
                syringes, and is spread by the sharing of IV drug paraphernalia.
                Thus, people who share needles and syringes, like most
                opiate-dependent users, are at the greatest risk of acquiring
                Hepatitis B. The hepatitis B virus causes a dangerous liver
                infection that may manifest symptoms and signs that range from
                minor to severe, normally occurring one to four months after the
                person has been infected, though they might also appear as early
                as two weeks. According to the <strong> Cleveland Clinic (n.d.),</strong> symptoms
                of hepatitis B include the following: <br />

                ● Mild fever <br />
                ● Muscles or joint pain <br />
                ● Stomach pain <br />
                ● Constipation <br />
                ● Loss of appetite <br />
                ● Loose stool <br />
                ● Brown urine <br />
                ● Having yellow skin or eyes (jaundice) <br />
                ● Being sick to the stomach <br />
                ● Lack of energy <br />
                <br />
                <strong>HIV INFECTION</strong> <br />
                The virus that causes Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
                infection is easily transmitted by sharing or reusing dirty
                syringes, which most opiate-dependent users do. The human
                immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that targets the immune
                system of the body, which may result in acquired
                immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) if not treated (About HIV/AIDS,
                n.d.). According to the <strong>Centers for Disease Control and
                Prevention (n.d.),</strong> possible symptoms of active HIV infection,
                which may last for several days or weeks, include the following:
                <br />

                ● Fever <br />
                ● Night sweats <br />
                ● Chills <br />
                ● Muscle aches <br />
                ● Rash <br />
                ● Fatigue <br />
                ● Sore throat <br />
                ● Mouth ulcers <br />
                ● Swollen lymph nodes <br />

                <br /><strong>PHLEBITIS</strong> <br />
                According to the study of <strong>Irish et al. (2007),</strong> intravenous
                injection can cause phlebitis or thrombophlebitis, which is an
                infection of the vein. Phlebitis refers to the inflammation of
                the vein which occurs due to blood clotting inside or damaged
                vein walls, which may manifest symptoms including redness of the
                skin and painful hard lumps underneath the skin <strong>(Phlebitis
                (superficial thrombophlebitis), n.d.).</strong> <br />

                <br /><strong>SUBACUTE BACTERIAL ENDOCARDITIS </strong>
                <br />
                Subacute bacterial endocarditis is a kind of infective
                endocarditis that happens when bacteria or other organisms
                travel through the bloodstream and target the heart valve
                lining. It leads to growth in the heart valves, also known as
                vegetations, which damages the valves and spreads the infection
                outside of the heart and blood arteries <strong>(What Is Subacute
                Bacterial Endocarditis?, n.d.).</strong> <br />

                <br /><strong>WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS </strong> As soon as six hours
                after the last drug dose and may continue for several days,
                withdrawal symptoms in opiate-dependent women may occur. The
                severity and duration of these symptoms are determined by the
                amount of drug used everyday, as well as the length of the
                dependence period. Withdrawal symptoms include the following:
                <br />
                ● Nausea <br />
                ● Vomiting <br />
                ● Diarrhea <br />
                ● Abdominal pain <br />
                ● Hypertension <br />
                ● Restlessness <br />
                ● Shivering <br />
                ● Insomnia <br />
                ● Body aches <br />

                    <strong>● Fetal Opiate Dependence</strong> <br />
                    Because drugs pass to babies from the placenta,
                    babies of opiate-dependent women will also be
                    dependent on the same drug.
                    <br /><br />
                    <strong>● Severe Withdrawal Symptoms</strong>
                    <br />
                    The fetus will experience the same withdrawal
                    symptoms as the mother would if she suddenly
                    stopped taking the drug. These symptoms include: ○
                    Nausea <br />
                    ○ Vomiting <br />
                    ○ Diarrhea <br />

                    <strong>● Small for gestational age</strong>
                    <br />
                    According to <strong>Liu et al. (2010),</strong> Intrauterine
                    Growth Restriction (IUGR) is a common occurrence
                    in the pregnancies of opioid-dependent mothers
                    (ODMs), and the causes are mostly unclear. <strong>Ratnam
                    (2020) </strong>defined small for gestational age as a term
                    used to describe a baby born with a lower weight
                    and is smaller in size than other babies born at
                    the same gestational age. <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong
                      >● Increased incidence of fetal distress and
                      meconium aspiration</strong
                    >
                    <br />
                    Fetal distress is an indication that something is
                    wrong with the baby, which occurs when the
                    placenta does not provide adequate oxygen to the
                    infant <strong>(Fetal distress, n.d.).</strong> If left untreated,
                    fetal stress and discomfort can result in meconium
                    aspiration syndrome, wherein the baby breathes the
                    meconium and amniotic fluid mixture into their
                    lungs <strong>(Burke, 2018).</strong> Fetal distress may occur due
                    to intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), which
                    is one of the risks to the fetuses of
                    opiate-dependent mothers.

                <h6>Narcotic Agonists</h6>
                <h4>Treatment and <em>Management</em></h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>● METHADONE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM</strong>
                    <br />
                    According to <strong>Goff and O’Connor (2007)</strong> as mentioned
                    by <strong>Pillitteri (2010),</strong> opiate-dependent women
                    should be placed into a methadone maintenance
                    program, which make use of methadone, a
                    long-acting synthetic opioid analgesic, to treat
                    Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). Because the said drug
                    is an analgesic, meaning it is a pain reliever,
                    during labor, or even postpartum, these women may
                    require stronger analgesic prescription <strong>(Meyer, et
                    al., 2007 as cited by Pillitteri, 2010).</strong> The
                    advantage of this program is that it guarantees
                    better nutrition of the fetus, better prenatal
                    care, and less risk of acquiring hepatitis B and
                    HIV. On the other hand, the disadvantage is that
                    withdrawal symptoms of infants at birth would
                    still occur. Unfortunately, some children born to
                    women who were on methadone experienced more
                    severe withdrawal symptoms than those born to
                    women who were on heroin. <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>● BUPRENORPHINE</strong>
                    <br />
                    According to <strong>Pillitteri (2010),</strong> the women may be
                    managed with buprenorphine if a methadone
                    treatment is not possible. A drug called Suboxone,
                    which is a combination of buprenorphine and
                    naloxone, can be used to treat Opioid Use Disorder
                    (OUD). <br />
