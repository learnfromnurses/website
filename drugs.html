              <p>
                Drugs are chemical molecules that have a psychoactive effect on
                the brain and body. The precise effects differ across
                individuals and also depend on the medicine, the dose, and the
                route of administration. Once a drug addiction takes place, it
                becomes the primary focus of a person's life. If you are hooked
                on narcotics, you will spend more time and money acquiring and
                utilizing them. This implies that you will have less time to
                engage in things you formerly enjoyed, such as sports and
                hobbies <strong>(Eske, 2020).</strong> <br /><br />
                Occasionally, medicines are necessary for the pregnant woman's
                and fetus's health. In such circumstances, a woman should
                discuss the risks and advantages of the medicine with her doctor
                or other health care practitioner. A pregnant woman should
                consult her health care practitioner before taking any
                medication (including over-the-counter medications) or dietary
                supplement (including medicinal herbs).
                <br /><br />
                Usage of illegal substances or misuse of prescription
                medications during pregnancy might have serious health effects
                for their infants. This is because many drugs readily pass
                through the placenta, which means that substances taken by a
                pregnant woman reach the fetus. Recent evidence indicates that
                consuming prescription pain medications or illicit narcotics
                during pregnancy increases the chance of stillbirth by a factor
                of two or even three. Regular use of some medicines can result
                in neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), in which the newborn
                undergoes withdrawal
                <strong>(National institute on Drug Abuse, 2021).</strong>
                <br /><br />
                In the United States, drug use among pregnant women is a rapidly
                growing problem. 4% of pregnant women take illicit drugs. As a
                result, 176,200 infants are at risk of developing birth
                abnormalities. These infants are at danger of preterm delivery,
                learning impairments, brain damage, HIV infection, drug
                addiction, delayed development, and birth deformities
                <strong>(12 keys, 2019).</strong> <br /><br />
                In 2013 and 2014, marijuana had the highest rate among pregnant
                women who use illicit drugs in the United States. This is
                followed by cocaine and other illicit drugs having an average
                number of 90,000 and 45,000 pregnant women users. At some point
                during pregnancy, more than 50% of pregnant women consume
                prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines,
                social drugs (such as cigarettes and alcohol), or illegal drugs,
                and drug use during pregnancy is growing. In general, medicines
                should be avoided during pregnancy unless absolutely essential,
                as many of them can be harmful to the fetus. Fewer than 2% to 3%
                of all birth abnormalities are caused by medicines given to
                treat a condition or symptom.

              <h4>About <em>cocaine </em></h4>
              <p>
                Cocaine is a Schedule II substance that is a strong stimulant
                with a high potential for abuse. Despite the fact that
                pharmaceutical cocaine is still used as a local anesthetic and
                vasoconstrictor, the bulk of cocaine is used illegally. Cocaine
                and other stimulants can be used to induce euphoria and increase
                a person's self-esteem. Some people take stimulants, including
                cocaine, to improve their mental and physical performance while
                also suppressing their hunger.
                <br /><br />
                Cocaine is made from the leaves of the South American coca shrub
                (Erythroxylum coca). Cocaine is made from the leaf extract in
                three distinct forms:

                Cocaine use during pregnancy might cause complications for both
                the pregnant mother and her unborn child. Some of these issues
                can be life-threatening. As a pregnant woman battling with
                cocaine addiction, or as someone who knows a pregnant woman
                struggling with cocaine addiction, it may be difficult to read
                about this issue. However, you must educate yourself on the
                risks of taking cocaine while pregnant in order to make the best
                and most educated decisions for yourself, your baby, or a loved
                one.

              <h4>Drugs : <em>Amphetamines</em></h4>
              <p>
                Amphetamines are stimulant medications, which accelerates the
                transmission of signals between the brain and body. Physicians
                prescribe some forms of amphetamines to treat illnesses such as
                attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy, and
                have also been utilized in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
                Other kinds of amphetamines, such as speed, are illicitly
                manufactured and sold. Amphetamines have also been used to
                increase athletic performance. Crystal methamphetamine is the
                most potent type (ice). Generally, amphetamines are ingested,
                injected, smoked, or snorted.
                <br /><br />
                Amphetamines are available in a variety of forms, from powder
                and tablets to crystals and capsules. When sold illegally, they
                may be packed in 'foils' (aluminum foil), plastic bags, or tiny
                balloons. Amphetamine powder ranges in color from white to
                brown, and occasionally contains traces of grey or pink. It has
                a pungent aroma and a bitter flavor. Capsules and tablets
                containing amphetamines vary significantly in size and color.
                Illegally manufactured amphetamines may contain a combination of
                pharmaceuticals, binding agents, caffeine, and sugar, as well as
                additional psychoactive chemicals.

              <h4>Drugs : <em>MARIJUANA AND HASHISH</em></h4>
              <p>
                Marijuana derives from the Hemp plant known as Cannabis Sativa.
                The main function, of the mind-altering chemical in marijuana,
                is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which targets the central nervous
                system. The present marijuana is reportedly 7 to 10 times more
                concentrated than marijuana used in the 1960s. Marijuana tends
                to be the first illegal and banned drug used by teenagers after
                tobacco and alcohol and it is considered a “gateway drug” as
                well as a primary addictive substance. Marijuana varies from all
                other common drugs of abuse in that it stays in the body far
                longer (up to 150 times as long as alcohol!) due to being
                fat-based instead of water-based. This “half-life” causes
                various negative effects.
                <br /><br />
                Effects: <br />
                Feelings of calm and relaxation, the heart and pulse rate
                increases, drowsiness/sleepiness, bloodshot eyes, paranoia,
                decrease in memory and coordination, Amotivational Syndrome (is
                a loss of motivation and interest in life), lung cancer,
                bronchitis, emphysema, infertility for both men and women,
                decrease in school and work performance, tolerance, withdrawal,
                and addiction.

                National Institute on Drug Abuse states that Phencyclidine, or
                PCP, is known as a dissociative drug, it is usually classified
                as a hallucinogen. The Global Library of Women's Medicine states
                that substance use is highly dominant in pregnant women, with an
                estimated 10% using illegal drugs such as PCP. The overwhelming
                effects of PCP include distorted perceptions of the senses and a
                feeling of detachment from the environment and self.

                Inhalants are ubiquitous household, industrial, and medicinal
                substances that emit vapours that some people inhale (breathe
                in) to induce euphoria or to make them feel intoxicated. They
                are also referred to as glue, gasoline, sniff, huff, chroming,
                or poppers. Through the nose or mouth, inhalants are inhaled; t
                hey can be sprayed into a plastic bag, poured into a bottle, or
                absorbed into a fabric or sleeve prior to inhalation. Sometimes,
                they are immediately inhaled from the container or sprayed
                straight into the mouth or nose but this practice is
                particularly risky because it has the potential to result in
                suffocation.

              <p>
                Narcotic agonists or opioid agonists are drugs used in relieving
                pain, such as morphine and meperidine, or suppressing cough such
                as codeine. These medications can be beneficial when taken
                carefully and under the supervision of a health care physician.
                However, misusing prescribed opioids can lead to dependency and
                addiction.
                <strong>(Prevent Opioid Abuse and Addiction, n.d.). </strong
                >These drugs produce potent analgesic or pain relief as well as
                the euphoric effect thus the reason why they are widely abused.
                <br /><br />
                Based on statistics done by the National Center for Drug Abuse
                Statistics (NCDAS), with 136 deaths each day and rising, the
                opioid crisis is deemed a public health emergency by the
                Department of Health and Human Services. NCDAS reported that
                every year, about 50,000 people die as a result of an opioid
                overdose. Also, in a given year, almost ten million people abuse
                opioids and opioids are involved in at least seven out of ten
                overdose deaths, which is a total of 72%.
                <strong>(Opioid Epidemic, n.d.).</strong> <br /><br />

                The Centers for Disease Prevention outlines the rise in opioid
                overdose deaths in three distinct waves. The first wave began in
                the 1990s with increased opioid prescribing. Prescription
                opioids, including natural and semi-synthetic opioids, as well
                as methadone, overdose deaths have been on the rise since at
                least 1999. With a sharp increase in heroin overdose deaths, the
                second wave occurred in 2010. The third wave started in 2013,
                with large rises in synthetic opioid overdose deaths, especially
                those containing illicitly made fentanyl
                <strong>(Understanding the Epidemic, n.d.).</strong>
                <br /><br />
                The main opiate recreationally used to the extent of dependence
                is the drug called Heroin. Heroin, which is made from morphine,
                is a highly addictive substance that works as a depressant that
                inhibits the central nervous system
                <strong>(Buddy, 2021).</strong> It is a short-acting narcotic
                that produces an instant and momentary euphoric effect followed
                by sedation, which may be administered intradermally,
                intravenously, or through inhalation.
