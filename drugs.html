              <h4>Drugs <em>info</em></h4>
              <p>
                Drugs are chemical molecules that have a psychoactive effect on
                the brain and body. The precise effects differ across
                individuals and also depend on the medicine, the dose, and the
                route of administration. Once a drug addiction takes place, it
                becomes the primary focus of a person's life. If you are hooked
                on narcotics, you will spend more time and money acquiring and
                utilizing them. This implies that you will have less time to
                engage in things you formerly enjoyed, such as sports and
                hobbies (Eske, 2020).
                <br /><br />
                Occasionally, medicines are necessary for the pregnant woman's
                and fetus's health. In such circumstances, a woman should
                discuss the risks and advantages of the medicine with her doctor
                or other health care practitioner. A pregnant woman should
                consult her health care practitioner before taking any
                medication (including over-the-counter medications) or dietary
                supplement (including medicinal herbs).
                <br /><br />
                Usage of illegal substances or misuse of prescription
                medications during pregnancy might have serious health effects
                for their infants. This is because many drugs readily pass
                through the placenta, which means that substances taken by a
                pregnant woman reach the fetus. Recent evidence indicates that
                consuming prescription pain medications or illicit narcotics
                during pregnancy increases the chance of stillbirth by a factor
                of two or even three. Regular use of some medicines can result
                in neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), in which the newborn
                undergoes withdrawal (National institute on Drug Abuse, 2021).
                <br /><br />
                In the United States, drug use among pregnant women is a rapidly
                growing problem. 4% of pregnant women take illicit drugs. As a
                result, 176,200 infants are at risk of developing birth
                abnormalities. These infants are at danger of preterm delivery,
                learning impairments, brain damage, HIV infection, drug
                addiction, delayed development, and birth deformities (12 keys,
                2019).
                <br /><br />
                In 2013 and 2014, marijuana had the highest rate among pregnant
                women who use illicit drugs in the United States. This is
                followed by cocaine and other illicit drugs having an average
                number of 90,000 and 45,000 pregnant women users. At some point
                during pregnancy, more than 50% of pregnant women consume
                prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines,
                social drugs (such as cigarettes and alcohol), or illegal drugs,
                and drug use during pregnancy is growing. In general, medicines
                should be avoided during pregnancy unless absolutely essential,
                as many of them can be harmful to the fetus. Fewer than 2% to 3%
                of all birth abnormalities are caused by medicines given to
                treat a condition or symptom.

              <h4>About <em>Coccaine </em></h4>
              <p>
                Cocaine is a Schedule II substance that is a strong stimulant
                with a high potential for abuse. Despite the fact that
                pharmaceutical cocaine is still used as a local anesthetic and
                vasoconstrictor, the bulk of cocaine is used illegally. Cocaine
                and other stimulants can be used to induce euphoria and increase
                a person's self-esteem. Some people take stimulants, including
                cocaine, to improve their mental and physical performance while
                also suppressing their hunger.
                <br /><br />
                Cocaine is made from the leaves of the South American coca shrub
                (Erythroxylum coca). Cocaine is made from the leaf extract in
                three distinct forms:

                    talcum powder, or sugar to dilute it.

                Cocaine use during pregnancy might cause complications for both
                the pregnant mother and her unborn child. Some of these issues
                can be life-threatening. As a pregnant woman battling with
                cocaine addiction, or as someone who knows a pregnant woman
                struggling with cocaine addiction, it may be difficult to read
                about this issue. However, you must educate yourself on the
                risks of taking cocaine while pregnant in order to make the best
                and most educated decisions for yourself, your baby, or a loved
                one.

                              ● Seek expert assistance - a professional knows
                              more than anybody else. Seeking professional
                              treatment from a doctor, licensed psychologist,
                              psychiatrist, mental health worker, or counselor
                              after admitting you have a problem and desire to
                              conquer your addiction is a critical step on the
                              road to recovery. They will be able to analyze
                              your condition and, if required, propose other
                              treatment alternatives. <br /><br />
                              ● Look for a residential treatment facility - If
                              outpatient counseling and treatment aren't enough,
                              a residential treatment program will not only
                              provide you with the support of your peers and
                              counselors, but will also keep you away from any
                              situations that can trigger you to use cocaine.

                              ● Join groups that provide assistance - peer
                              support organizations, such as Cocaine Anonymous
                              or Narcotics Anonymous, can provide a secure,
                              comfortable environment for you to share your
                              thoughts, feelings, and actions with others who
                              are going through the same thing and can relate,
                              whether in person or online. <br /><br />
                              ● Medication - There are currently no FDA-approved
                              medications for the treatment of cocaine use
                              disorder or addiction. Certain antidepressants and
                              stimulants, as well as other medications, may be
                              administered to aid with cravings, withdrawal
                              symptoms, or even to negate the positive effects
                              of cocaine use.

              <h4>Drugs : <em>Amphetamines</em></h4>
              <p>
                Amphetamines are stimulant medications, which accelerates the
                transmission of signals between the brain and body. Physicians
                prescribe some forms of amphetamines to treat illnesses such as
                attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy, and
                have also been utilized in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
                Other kinds of amphetamines, such as speed, are illicitly
                manufactured and sold. Amphetamines have also been used to
                increase athletic performance. Crystal methamphetamine is the
                most potent type (ice). Generally, amphetamines are ingested,
                injected, smoked, or snorted.
                <br /><br />
                Amphetamines are available in a variety of forms, from powder
                and tablets to crystals and capsules. When sold illegally, they
                may be packed in 'foils' (aluminum foil), plastic bags, or tiny
                balloons. Amphetamine powder ranges in color from white to
                brown, and occasionally contains traces of grey or pink. It has
                a pungent aroma and a bitter flavor. Capsules and tablets
                containing amphetamines vary significantly in size and color.
                Illegally manufactured amphetamines may contain a combination of
                pharmaceuticals, binding agents, caffeine, and sugar, as well as
                additional psychoactive chemicals.

                              are at increased risk for mental co-morbidity and
                              worse obstetric outcomes, but their babies may go
                              undetected since the indications of withdrawal are

                              have been shown to suffer clefting, heart

                              impairments. Because exposed children may be at

                              impairment, the authors advocate increasing the

                              affected children and their families.

                              that there is a problem. Once you've decided that

                              the next step is to seek assistance and
                              assistance.

                              your behaviors and the reasons for your use of
                              amphetamines. Involving family and friends
                              throughout therapy might help you feel supported
                              and prevent you from relapsing into substance
                              abuse. <br />
                              If you are experiencing severe withdrawal
                              symptoms, you may be required to remain in a
                              residential treatment facility. As you recuperate,
                              your health and safety may be monitored in that
                              facility. Amphetamine usage can be reduced by
                              inhibiting the effects of amphetamines, however at
                              this time, there is no medication that can assist
                              with this.

              <h4>Drugs : <em>MARIJUANA AND HASHISH</em></h4>
              <p>
                Marijuana derives from the Hemp plant known as Cannabis Sativa.
                The main function, of the mind-altering chemical in marijuana,
                is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which targets the central nervous
                system. The present marijuana is reportedly 7 to 10 times more
                concentrated than marijuana used in the 1960s. Marijuana tends
                to be the first illegal and banned drug used by teenagers after
                tobacco and alcohol and it is considered a “gateway drug” as
                well as a primary addictive substance. Marijuana varies from all
                other common drugs of abuse in that it stays in the body far
                longer (up to 150 times as long as alcohol!) due to being
                fat-based instead of water-based. This “half-life” causes
                various negative effects.
                <br /><br />
                Effects: <br />
                Feelings of calm and relaxation, the heart and pulse rate
                increases, drowsiness/sleepiness, bloodshot eyes, paranoia,
                decrease in memory and coordination, Amotivational Syndrome (is
                a loss of motivation and interest in life), lung cancer,
                bronchitis, emphysema, infertility for both men and women,
                decrease in school and work performance, tolerance, withdrawal,
                and addiction.

                National Institute on Drug Abuse states that Phencyclidine, or
                PCP, is known as a dissociative drug, it is usually classified
                as a hallucinogen. The Global Library of Women's Medicine states
                that substance use is highly dominant in pregnant women, with an
                estimated 10% using illegal drugs such as PCP. The overwhelming
                effects of PCP include distorted perceptions of the senses and a
                feeling of detachment from the environment and self.

                            <h4>TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT</h4>
                            <p>
                              A PCP overdose cannot be treated with any specific
                              medications. Treatment is frequently adjusted to
                              the individual's appearance. If a patient is
                              aggressive, violent, confused, or delusional,
                              sedative drugs (typically benzodiazepines) and
                              restraints are frequently used. Until the person
                              calms down, environmental stimuli should be
                              maintained. This mainly involves turning off
                              lights, reducing noise, and restricting visitors
                              and medical workers to a bare minimum.
                              <br />
                              In order to administer some medications, the
                              patient may have to be intubated if they are
                              excessively hyperactive or anxious. After a person
                              has been restrained, they can be administered
                              intravenous fluids and activated charcoal,
                              specifically when it is suspected that the person
                              took the drug PCP orally. In instances of PCP
                              overdose, activated charcoal has been shown to
                              absorb PCP and reduce the risk of renal failure.
                              Elevated body temperatures might necessitate the
                              use of liquids and ventilation to cool them down.
                              <br />
                              The practitioners will keep an eye on the
                              patient's vital signs and address any further
                              symptoms that arise. Benzodiazepines can be used
                              to manage seizure activity. Antipsychotic drugs
                              may be utilized in certain circumstances if the
                              patient's behavior is openly psychotic.

              <h4>Drugs : <em>INHALANTS</em></h4>
              <p>
                Inhalants are ubiquitous household, industrial, and medicinal
                substances that emit vapours that some people inhale (breathe
                in) to induce euphoria or to make them feel intoxicated. They
                are also referred to as glue, gasoline, sniff, huff, chroming,
                or poppers. Through the nose or mouth, inhalants are inhaled; t
                hey can be sprayed into a plastic bag, poured into a bottle, or
                absorbed into a fabric or sleeve prior to inhalation. Sometimes,
                they are immediately inhaled from the container or sprayed
                straight into the mouth or nose but this practice is
                particularly risky because it has the potential to result in
                suffocation.

                              Inhalants include several poisonous compounds
                              which are harmful to both the mother and the
                              child. It is thought that practically all
                              inhalants penetrate the placenta and enter the
                              baby's bloodstream. For this reason, it is crucial
                              you cease utilizing inhalants during pregnancy.

                              There are only a restricted number of effective

                              Prenatal alcohol consumption has been demonstrated
                              to be reduced by brief treatments particularly
                              those that make use of motivational interviewing
                              techniques. A recent randomized study with a

                              this way of reducing prenatal drinking may yield
                              benefits that are comparable to those obtained

              <h4>Drugs : <em>NARCOTIC AGONISTS</em></h4>
              <p>
                Narcotic agonists or opioid agonists are drugs used in relieving
                pain, such as morphine and meperidine, or suppressing cough such
                as codeine. These medications can be beneficial when taken
                carefully and under the supervision of a health care physician.
                However, misusing prescribed opioids can lead to dependency and
                addiction. (Prevent Opioid Abuse and Addiction, n.d.). These
                drugs produce potent analgesic or pain relief as well as the
                euphoric effect thus the reason why they are widely abused.
                <br /><br />
                Based on statistics done by the National Center for Drug Abuse
                Statistics (NCDAS), with 136 deaths each day and rising, the
                opioid crisis is deemed a public health emergency by the
                Department of Health and Human Services. NCDAS reported that
                every year, about 50,000 people die as a result of an opioid
                overdose. Also, in a given year, almost ten million people abuse
                opioids and opioids are involved in at least seven out of ten
                overdose deaths, which is a total of 72%. (Opioid Epidemic,
                n.d.).
                <br /><br />

                The Centers for Disease Prevention outlines the rise in opioid
                overdose deaths in three distinct waves. The first wave began in
                the 1990s with increased opioid prescribing. Prescription
                opioids, including natural and semi-synthetic opioids, as well
                as methadone, overdose deaths have been on the rise since at
                least 1999. With a sharp increase in heroin overdose deaths, the
                second wave occurred in 2010. The third wave started in 2013,
                with large rises in synthetic opioid overdose deaths, especially
                those containing illicitly made fentanyl (Understanding the
                Epidemic, n.d.).
                <br /><br />
                The main opiate recreationally used to the extent of dependence
                is the drug called Heroin. Heroin, which is made from morphine,
                is a highly addictive substance that works as a depressant that
                inhibits the central nervous system (Buddy, 2021). It is a
                short-acting narcotic that produces an instant and momentary
                euphoric effect followed by sedation, which may be administered
                intradermally, intravenously, or through inhalation.

                              Because narcotics are usually injected through the
                              use of shared needles, pregnancy complications of
                              opiate-dependent women include the following:
                              <br />
                              According to Mayo Clinic (n.d.), Hepatitis B Virus
                              (HBV) is easily transmitted by infected
                              blood-contaminated needles and syringes, and is
                              spread by the sharing of IV drug paraphernalia.
                              Thus, people who share needles and syringes, like
                              most opiate-dependent users, are at the greatest
                              risk of acquiring Hepatitis B. The hepatitis B
                              virus causes a dangerous liver infection that may
                              manifest symptoms and signs that range from minor
                              to severe, normally occurring one to four months
                              after the person has been infected, though they
                              might also appear as early as two weeks. According
                              to the Cleveland Clinic (n.d.), symptoms of
                              hepatitis B include the following: <br />

                              ● Mild fever <br />
                              ● Muscles or joint pain <br />
                              ● Stomach pain <br />

                              <strong>HIV INFECTION</strong> <br />
                              The virus that causes Human Immunodeficiency Virus
                              (HIV) infection is easily transmitted by sharing
                              or reusing dirty syringes, which most
                              opiate-dependent users do. The human
                              immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that
                              targets the immune system of the body, which may
                              result in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
                              (AIDS) if not treated (About HIV/AIDS, n.d.).
                              According to the Centers for Disease Control and

                              infection, which may last for several days or
                              weeks, include the following: <br />

                              ● Fever <br />
                              ● Night sweats <br />

                              ● Fatigue <br />
                              ● Sore throat <br />

                              <br /><strong>PHLEBITIS</strong> <br />
                              According to the study of Irish et al. (2007),
                              intravenous injection can cause phlebitis or
                              thrombophlebitis, which is an infection of the
                              vein. Phlebitis refers to the inflammation of the
                              vein which occurs due to blood clotting inside or
                              damaged vein walls, which may manifest symptoms
                              including redness of the skin and painful hard
                              lumps underneath the skin (Phlebitis (superficial
                              thrombophlebitis), n.d.). <br />

                              Subacute bacterial endocarditis is a kind of
                              infective endocarditis that happens when bacteria
                              or other organisms travel through the bloodstream
                              and target the heart valve lining. It leads to
                              growth in the heart valves, also known as
                              vegetations, which damages the valves and spreads
                              the infection outside of the heart and blood
                              arteries (What Is Subacute Bacterial

                              soon as six hours after the last drug dose and may
                              continue for several days, withdrawal symptoms in
                              opiate-dependent women may occur. The severity and
                              duration of these symptoms are determined by the
                              amount of drug used everyday, as well as the
                              length of the dependence period. Withdrawal
                              symptoms include the following: <br />
                              ● Nausea <br />

                              According to Liu et al. (2010), Intrauterine
                              Growth Restriction (IUGR) is a common occurrence
                              in the pregnancies of opioid-dependent mothers
                              (ODMs), and the causes are mostly unclear. Ratnam
                              (2020) defined small for gestational age as a term
                              used to describe a baby born with a lower weight
                              and is smaller in size than other babies born at
                              the same gestational age. <br />

                                meconium aspiration</strong

                              Fetal distress is an indication that something is
                              wrong with the baby, which occurs when the
                              placenta does not provide adequate oxygen to the
                              infant (Fetal distress, n.d.). If left untreated,
                              fetal stress and discomfort can result in meconium
                              aspiration syndrome, wherein the baby breathes the
                              meconium and amniotic fluid mixture into their
                              lungs (Burke, 2018). Fetal distress may occur due
                              to intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), which
                              is one of the risks to the fetuses of
                              opiate-dependent mothers.

                            <h4>TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT</h4>
                            <p>
                              <strong>● METHADONE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM</strong>
                              <br />
                              According to Goff and O’Connor (2007) as mentioned
                              by Pillitteri (2010), opiate-dependent women
                              should be placed into a methadone maintenance
                              program, which make use of methadone, a
                              long-acting synthetic opioid analgesic, to treat
                              Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). Because the said drug
                              is an analgesic, meaning it is a pain reliever,
                              during labor, or even postpartum, these women may
                              require stronger analgesic prescription (Meyer, et
                              al., 2007 as cited by Pillitteri, 2010). The
                              advantage of this program is that it guarantees
                              better nutrition of the fetus, better prenatal
                              care, and less risk of acquiring hepatitis B and
                              HIV. On the other hand, the disadvantage is that
                              withdrawal symptoms of infants at birth would
                              still occur. Unfortunately, some children born to
                              women who were on methadone experienced more
                              severe withdrawal symptoms than those born to
                              women who were on heroin. <br />
                              <br />
                              <strong>● BUPRENORPHINE</strong>
                              <br />
                              According to Pillitteri (2010), the women may be
                              managed with buprenorphine if a methadone
                              treatment is not possible. A drug called Suboxone,
                              which is a combination of buprenorphine and
                              naloxone, can be used to treat Opioid Use Disorder
                              (OUD). <br />
