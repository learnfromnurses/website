              <h6>Facts</h6>
              <h4>Alcohol <em>info</em></h4>
              <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                Pregnant women are highly advised not to consume alcohol while
                they are pregnant. In terms of social connectedness and relaxation, alcohol has
                played a long-standing role in culture. This includes beer,
                wine, wine coolers, and liquor. Overconsumption, on the other
                hand, has been linked to many major health and social issues.
                Alcohol use in pregnancy is still widespread, with the global
                prevalence of alcohol consumption in pregnancy estimated to be
                9.8% from 1984 to 2014, with rates changing depending on where
                the woman resides <strong>(Dejong et.al., 2020). </strong></p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> Approximately 80% of women agree to drinking alcohol prior
                to being pregnant, 50% admit to drinking early in pregnancy
                before becoming pregnant, and 18% admit to drinking alcohol
                periodically throughout their pregnancy. Importantly, 11% admit
                to binge drinking throughout the first trimester of their
                pregnancy. Seventy percent of mothers who continued to drink
                during pregnancy reduced their intake to less than one unit per
                week <strong>(Khalil et al., 2010).</strong> </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                Alcohol crosses the placenta quickly, when a pregnant woman
                drinks, the alcohol passes through her bloodstream and into the
                blood, tissues, and organs of the baby in just 2 hours. In a
                baby's body, alcohol breaks down far more slowly than in an
                adult's. That indicates the baby's blood alcohol level is higher
                than the mother's for a longer period of time. Alcohol is a
                known teratogen that can affect fetal development and growth at
                any stage of pregnancy. This can be harmful to the newborn and
                can sometimes result in long-term consequences. As a result,
                there is no such thing as a "safe" level of alcohol consumption
                during pregnancy. According to some research, even small doses
                of alcohol might have the same negative impact on the fetus as
                binge drinking <strong>(Dejong et.al., 2020).</strong>

              <h4>WHAT IS <em>CAFFEINE?</em></h4>
              <p>
                Caffeine is a naturally occurring stimulant that is extensively
                taken across the globe. It helps you remain alert and may help
                you avoid feeling fatigued <strong>(Lieberman et. al., 1987).</strong></p>
                <br />
                <br /> 
                <h4>HOW IT <em>WORKS?</em></h4>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                Caffeine works by activating the central nervous system, the
                heart, the muscles, and the blood pressure-regulating regions.
                Caffeine can elevate blood pressure but may not do so in chronic
                caffeine users. Caffeine can also function as a diuretic,
                increasing urine output. Caffeine is most frequently used for
                mental alertness, headaches, migraines, athletic performance,
                memory, and weight loss. Additionally, it is used to treat
                asthma, gallbladder disease, ADHD, hypotension, and depression,
                among other diseases <strong>(Grosso, 2017).</strong>

                    Individuals who require a great deal of mental, creative, and intellectual work are literally compelled to stimulate themselves with coffee, which is OK provided you can manage your daily coffee consumption and are aware of your own boundaries. In this situation, productivity does really rise, and there is no harm to health. These employees frequently consume coffee throughout the day and  even after work <strong>(Hudyakova, 2020). </strong>

              <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                Drugs are chemical molecules that have a psychoactive effect on
                the brain and body. The precise effects differ across
                individuals and also depend on the medicine, the dose, and the
                route of administration. Once a drug addiction takes place, it
                becomes the primary focus of a person's life. If you are hooked
                on narcotics, you will spend more time and money acquiring and
                utilizing them. This implies that you will have less time to
                engage in things you formerly enjoyed, such as sports and
                hobbies <strong>(Eske, 2020).</strong> </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                Occasionally, medicines are necessary for the pregnant woman's
                and fetus's health. In such circumstances, a woman should
                discuss the risks and advantages of the medicine with her doctor
                or other health care practitioner. A pregnant woman should
                consult her health care practitioner before taking any
                medication (including over-the-counter medications) or dietary
                supplement (including medicinal herbs). </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                Usage of illegal substances or misuse of prescription
                medications during pregnancy might have serious health effects
                for their infants. This is because many drugs readily pass
                through the placenta, which means that substances taken by a
                pregnant woman reach the fetus. Recent evidence indicates that
                consuming prescription pain medications or illicit narcotics
                during pregnancy increases the chance of stillbirth by a factor
                of two or even three. Regular use of some medicines can result
                in neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), in which the newborn
                undergoes withdrawal <strong>(National institute on Drug Abuse, 2021).</strong>

                In the United States, drug use among pregnant women is a rapidly
                growing problem. 4% of pregnant women take illicit drugs. As a
                result, 176,200 infants are at risk of developing birth
                abnormalities. These infants are at danger of preterm delivery,
                learning impairments, brain damage, HIV infection, drug
                addiction, delayed development, and birth deformities (12 keys,
                2019).

                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                In 2013 and 2014, marijuana had the highest rate among pregnant
                women who use illicit drugs in the United States. This is
                followed by cocaine and other illicit drugs having an average
                number of 90,000 and 45,000 pregnant women users. At some point
                during pregnancy, more than 50% of pregnant women consume
                prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines,
                social drugs (such as cigarettes and alcohol), or illegal drugs,
                and drug use during pregnancy is growing. In general, medicines
                should be avoided during pregnancy unless absolutely essential,
                as many of them can be harmful to the fetus. Fewer than 2% to 3%
                of all birth abnormalities are caused by medicines given to
                treat a condition or symptom.

              <h4>WHAT IS <em>SMOKING AND TOBACCO?</em></h4>
              <p>
                Tobacco is manufactured from the tobacco plant's leaves. It
                includes nicotine, a very addictive substance. When you smoke
                tobacco in the form of cigarettes, cigars, or pipes, you absorb
                harmful and carcinogenic compounds that have a harmful effect on
                your health (Henningfield, 2019).

                <h4>WHAT IS <em>SMOKING?</em></h4>
                <p>
                It is an inhalation and exhalation of gasses produced by burning
                plant material. While several plant materials, including
                marijuana and hashish, are inhaled, the act is most often
                associated with tobacco, whether in the form of a cigar,
                cigarette, or pipes <strong>(Henningfield, 2019).</strong>
