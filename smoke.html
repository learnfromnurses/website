              <h4>WHAT IS <em>SMOKING AND TOBACCO?</em></h4>
              <p>
                Tobacco is manufactured from the tobacco plant's leaves. It
                includes nicotine, a very addictive substance. When you smoke
                tobacco in the form of cigarettes, cigars, or pipes, you absorb
                harmful and carcinogenic compounds that have a harmful effect on
                your health <strong>(Henningfield, 2019).</strong>

                <br />
                WHAT IS SMOKING?
                <br />
                It is an inhalation and exhalation of gasses produced by burning
                plant material. While several plant materials, including
                marijuana and hashish, are inhaled, the act is most often
                associated with tobacco, whether in the form of a cigar,
                cigarette, or pipes <strong>(Henningfield, 2019).</strong>

              <p>  
              A plant whose leaves contain a high concentration of nicotine. Curing and aging tobacco leaves after they've been harvested is a time-consuming procedure that might take many weeks or months. It is possible to inhale, apply to the gums, or smoke the final products (in cigarettes, cigars, and pipes) (as snuff). It is known as Nicotiana tabacum by its scientific name <strong>(NIDA, 2021). </strong>
              <br>
              <br>
              Nicotine is the main chemical in tobacco. It is: <br>                              	 
              ●	Highly addictive     	 <br>
              ●	A stimulant, in  other words, it expedites communication between the brain and the body. <br>
              ●	Toxic <br>  
              <br>
              One of the most serious risks to global public health, the  tobacco pandemic claims the lives of more than 8 million  people each year. A total of more than 7 million people died as a direct result of smoking, while another 1.2 million died because of second-hand smoke exposure <strong>(Huang et. al., 2014)</strong>
              <br><br>
              In low- and middle-income nations, more than 80 percent of the world's 1.3 billion tobacco users are exposed to the
              greatest risk of disease and death from smoking. Tobacco usage makes it harder for families to meet their most necessities, including buying food and housing <strong>(Piper et. al., 2011)</strong> <br><br>
              Tobacco usage has a considerable negative impact on the economy, as well as health care expenses and lost human
              capital because of the illnesses and deaths caused by tobacco  use <strong>(Henningfield, 2019). </strong>        	 
              Oftentimes, youngsters from low-income families are  engaged as tobacco farm workers to raise their families'  incomes. Several health dangers, such as "green tobacco  disease," are also faced by farmers who cultivate tobacco  <strong>(Huang et. al., 2014)</strong>

              <p>
                Nicotine is found in the circulation for one to three days,  whereas cotinine may be identified for up to ten days. Nicotine may be detected in your blood by qualitative (if nicotine is present) and quantitative testing (how much nicotine is present). Nicotine, cotinine, and another breakdown product called anabases may all be detected with these assays. False positives for nicotine are a frequent occurrence in blood tests. This is often due to the presence of a substance called thiocyanate. It is present in a variety of  foods, including broccoli and cabbage, as well as some  pharmaceuticals <strong>(Duggal, 2019).</strong>

              <p>  
                Cigarettes contain over 600 different components. Cigarettes  emit more than 7,000 chemicals into the air when they are  burnt. It has been shown that at least 69 of these substances  are carcinogenic, and many more are harmful <strong>(Henningfield, 2019).</strong> Consumer items, such as rat poison, contain many of the  same ingredients, but they carry warning labels. Tobacco  smoke contains toxins, yet the public is not told about the  dangers of these goods <strong>(Nordqvist, 2015).</strong>

              <h4>IS SMOKING TOBACCO REALLY <em>ADDICTIVE</em></h4>
              <p>
                Addiction is characterized by a compulsive need for or usage  of a drug or substance, even though doing so has negative consequences. Addiction is a physical or psychological dependency on a drug. Tobacco contains the highly addictive drug nicotine. Many people get addicted to tobacco products after using them on a regular basis. A naturally found chemical, nicotine, is as addictive as heroin or cocaine, and it is found in cigarettes <strong>(Gabbey, 2018).</strong> <br><br>
                Nicotine is the addictive component of tobacco and a key source of TSNAs. 3 Tobacco smoke contains nicotine, which is readily absorbed by the alveoli. Nicotine is a bolus that circulates throughout the body. Subsequent release of dopamine via cholinergic receptor activation and regulation of hormones like cortisol is thought to cause nicotine dependence. The impact of dopamine transporter (SLC6A3) and dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) polymorphisms on  smoking initiation and nicotine dependence is still debated <strong>(Ohmoto et. al., 2014).</strong>

The most prevalent kind is loose-leaf tobacco, which is sweetened and wrapped in a foil pouch. Each form requires the user to remove a component from the packaging and insert it between their gums and cheek <strong>(Lukowsky, 2015)</strong> </p>

                <h6>Smoking</h6>
                <h4>Risk to the<em> Mother</em></h4>
                <p>  
                  ● DIFFICULTY GETTING PREGNANT <br />
                              Women who smoke do not conceive as effectively as nonsmokers. The risk for fertility problems increases with the number of cigarettes smoked daily (ASRM, 2014). Female smokers need more ovary-stimulating medications during IVF and still have fewer eggs at retrieval time and have 30% lower pregnancy rates compared with IVF patients who do not smoke. Unfortunately, once eggs die off, they cannot regenerate or be replaced. This means that menopause occurs 1 to 4 years earlier in women who smoke (compared with non-smokers).  (ASRM, 2014). <br><br>
                              ● PLACENTA COMPLICATIONS <br>                             
                              Placenta covers the cervix causing complications during labor or separates from the womb too early causing bleeding (Philomena, 2016). Maternal smoking significantly affected 18% of protein spots and also, it affects the systems controlling the development and function of placenta (Huuskonen et al., 2016).
                              <br><br>
                              ● ECTOPIC PREGNANCY <br>                          
                              Pregnancy occurs outside the womb i.e. in one of the fallopian tubes (Philomena, 2016). It is a condition in which the fertilized egg attaches to the wall of the fallopian tube or elsewhere outside the womb and begins to develop but cannot survive (CDC, 2010). The multivariate results showed a strong relationship between smoking and ectopic pregnancy risk. Compared with women who had never smoked, those who had smoked in the past had 50% higher odds of ectopic pregnancy (Guttmacher, 2003).
                              <br><br>
                              ● HEART DISEASE <br>
                              Smoking harms nearly every organ in your body, including your heart. Smoking can cause blockages and narrowing in your arteries, which means less blood and oxygen flow to your heart (American Lung Association, 2022). Just a few cigarettes a day, occasional smoking, or exposure to second-hand smoke increase the risk of heart disease. But if tobacco users take immediate action and quit, then their risk of heart disease will decrease by 50% after one year of not smoking (Guevarra, 2020).
                              <br><br>
                              ● VULNERABLE TO INFECTION <br>
                                Smoking is one of the main risk factors for infections in the respiratory tract, digestive tract, reproductive tract, and other systems in humans, increasing the prevalence of HIV, tuberculosis, SARS-CoV, and the current SARS-CoV-2 (Jiang et al., 2020). Overall, around 70 pregnant or recently-pregnant women per 1000 live births were found to have a maternal infection needing hospital management. Across the study, 11 women with either direct or indirect infection per 1000 live births developed a severe maternal outcome, but in low- and middle-income countries up to 15 women per 1000 births were affected (WHO, 2020).
                              <br><br>
                              ● INCREASED RISK OF MISCARRIAGE/SPONTANEOUS ABORTION
                              Smoking and being exposed to secondhand smoke can increase the chances of having a miscarriage (Danielsson, 2019). The risk of miscarriage increased with the amount smoked (1% increase in relative risk per cigarette smoked per day) and secondhand smoke exposure during pregnancy increased the risk of miscarriage by 11%  (Pineles et al., 2014).
                              <br><br>
                              ● WEAKER LUNGS <br>
                                Cigarettes can harm the tissue of the lungs, impeding their ability to function properly, and can increase the risk for conditions such as emphysema, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (FDA, 2020). Those with mothers who had smoked more than 20 cigarettes a day had 2.7 times the risk of airflow obstruction in middle age compared to those not exposed, according to the results published in Respirology (Doyle, 2016). Lung cancer is the most common form of the disease in the world and 90 percent of all cases are caused by cigarette smoking. It kills 1.2 million people a year (Kelland, 2010).
                                <br><br>   
                                ● DIABETES <br>
                              The mother's excess amounts of blood glucose are transferred to the fetus during pregnancy. This causes the baby's body to secrete increased amounts of insulin, which results in increased tissue and fat deposits. The infant of a diabetic mother  is often larger than expected for the gestational age (Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, n.d). You're more likely to get type 2 diabetes if you smoke. People who smoke cigarettes are 30% to 40% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than people who don't smoke (American Lung Association, 2022). 
                              <br><br>
                              ● STROKE <br>
                              Because smoking affects your arteries, it can trigger stroke. A stroke happens when the blood supply to your brain is temporarily blocked. Brain cells are deprived of oxygen and start to die. A stroke can cause paralysis, slurred speech, altered brain function and death (American Lung Association, 2022). As recurrent strokes occur in 25–30% of cases, identification of risk factors for stroke in a young woman is important as this will direct the approach to secondary prevention and management in future pregnancies (Khalid et al., 2019).
                              <br><br>
                              
                              ● BLINDNESS, CATARACTS, AND AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION <br>
                              Smoking can make you go blind. It damages your eyes and can result in vision loss. Age-related macular degeneration is caused by smoking. It is the leading cause of blindness in adults ages 65 and older (American Lung Association., 2022). A low proportion of smokers from Canada (13.0%), the United States (9.5%), and the United Kingdom (9.7%) believed that smoking can cause blindness. In contrast, 47.2% of Australian smokers believed that smoking causes blindness (Kennedy et al., 2015).

                <h6>Smoking</h6>
                <h4>Risk to the<em> Child</em></h4>
                <p>  
                  ● LOW BIRTH WEIGHT <br />
                              Smoking during pregnancy results in 20-30% of low birth weight babies (Philomena, 2016). On average, about 150 to 200 grams less than normal (Better Health, n.d). One in every five babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy has low birth weight. Mothers who are exposed to secondhand smoke while pregnant are more likely to have lower birth weight babies (CDC, 2020).
                              <br><br>
                              ● NEONATAL ASPHYXIA (OXYGEN DEPRIVATION) <br />
                              Birth asphyxia is a condition in which a baby does not receive enough oxygen before, during, or directly after birth. Insufficient oxygen supply to the body can cause low levels of oxygen or a buildup of excess acid in the baby’s blood (Nwadike, 2020). Body cooling (therapeutic hypothermia) can improve outcomes for babies born at full term or near term. But babies born 5 or more weeks early cannot have body cooling. In the most severe cases, asphyxia can lead to organ failure and death (Seattle Children’s, n.d). Among babies born full-term in the U.S., 3 in 1,000 will suffer from some degree of brain damage. Being deprived of oxygen during birth, known as asphyxiation, is a leading cause of infant brain damage (Jansheski, 2022).
                              <br><br>
                              ● INCREASED RISK OF PREMATURE BIRTH <br />
                              Nicotine and other chemicals in cigarettes, smoking behaviors and other factors may contribute to wrinkles and premature aging of the skin (Hays, 2020). Smoking throughout pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. However, quitting early in pregnancy negates this risk. Widespread programs aimed at smoking cessation early in pregnancy could have a significant impact on reducing the rate of preterm birth nationally (DO et al., 2016). Cigarette smoking cessation, especially early in pregnancy, was associated with reduced risk of preterm birth, even for high-frequency cigarette smokers (Soneji & Beltran-Sanchez, 2019).
                              <br><br>
                              ● SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME<br />
                              This is a condition when the infant dies suddenly without any warning signs. While doctors are unable to find an explanation as to how smoking is responsible for this, numerous studies have shown that there is a direct correlation (Tian, 2017). The annual incidence of SIDS in the United States is now approximately 0.5 per 1000 live births. And with a peak incidence occurring at 2 to 3 months of life and rarely occurring after 6 months of age (Kliegman, 2020).
                              <br><br>
                              ● BIRTH/CONGENITAL DEFECTS <br />
                              Babies exposed to cigarette smoke due to smoking during the first month of pregnancy are more prone to have congenital problems like cleft lip, cardiac anomalies, etc. (Tian, 2017). The findings from 174, 000 cases of malformation and it is revealed that smoking increases the risk of abnormalities such as cleft lip/palate with 28% (Roberts, 2011)
                              <br><br>
                              ● IMMUNE DEFICIENCIES<br />
                              Cigarette smoke affects the hematopoietic stem cells, thereby lowering the immunity cells. This, in turn, makes the baby more prone to infections (Tian, 2017). 
                              The study team measured various indicators of the immune system functioning in the newborn blood samples. The researchers compared the levels of these immune substances among children grouped by their mother’s smoking status: non-smoker, stopped within the first trimester, stopped after the first trimester, or smoked throughout pregnancy. The team also evaluated children exposed to secondhand smoke. Overall, samples from nearly 3,500 children were analyzed (NIH, 2016).
                              <br><br>
                              ● DEVELOPMENTAL ISSUES<br />
                              It hampers the physical as well as neurological growth, which may cause stunting and mental retardation. It is also an important cause of poor scholastic performance (Tian, 2017). According to (Wehby et al., 2012), that it reduces the child neurodevelopment rate by about 2.5 percentage points per cigarette. 
                              <br><br>
                              ● HIGHER RISK OF ASTHMA<br />
                              Smoke irritates the airways, making them swollen, narrow, and filled with sticky mucus — the same things that happen during an asthma flare-up. That's why smoking can cause asthma flare-ups (or "attacks") to happen more often (Ben-Joseph, 2017). About 1 in 12 of 6 million children in the US ages 0-17 years have asthma (CDC, 2018).

                <h6>Smoking</h6>
                <h4>Treatment and<em> Management</em></h4>
                <p>  
                  According to an article entitled “Quit Smoking”, only a person can decide whether he or she is ready to quit smoking. Therefore, before taking this action, a person must list all the reasons in order for this to serve as a motivation and foundation that will support his or her quit smoking plan.
                  These reasons might include: <br>
                  ●	For health improvement <br>
                  ●	To lower the possibility of developing disease in the future <br>
                  ●	To not expose family and friends from secondhand smoke <br>
                  ●	In order to save money <br>
                  Then a person will start to choose a specific day to quit smoking. This may be hard to follow but giving yourself time to prepare. Choosing a day might be stressful but a person must choose a day that is significant to him or her <strong>(Quit Smoking, 2020).</strong> <br>
                  <br>
                  SMOKING <br>
                  According to <strong>Cressman et al (2012),</strong> alternative medications like nicotine replacement therapy (NTR) are available for pregnant women who wish to stop smoking. These nicotine replacement therapy (NTR) can help with pregnant women’s cravings, hence, reduces the symptoms. Although there are people who don’t succeed with NTR during their first try, the use of NTR during pregnancy is much safer than smoking <strong>(Blanc et al, 2021).</strong> <br>
                  Furthermore, NRT can be delivered through buccal absorption products like gums, inhaler, nasal and buccal spray, lozenge, or as a patch. According to an article entitled “Nicotine Replacement Therapy in pregnancy”, these NRT delivers lower levels of nicotine to the fetus than continued smoking. As of now, there is no evidence that using NRT increases the possibility of developing risks for pregnancy or cases with worse delivery outcomes that are associated with the use of NTR <strong>(Blanc et al, 2021).</strong>
                  <br>
                  <br> 
                  1.	NICOTINE PATCH (Transdermal Nicotine System) </p>
                  <div class="left-image">
                    <img src="assets/images/SMOKING/TREATMENT _ MANAGEMENT/1.jpg" alt="" />
                  </div>
                  <p>Nicotine patches are available with different types and strengths, including 16 and 24 hour patches. These patches have a measured dose of nicotine placed through the skin. This can be bought with or without prescription but make sure that the person must consult first with their attending physician <strong>(Nicotine Replacement Therapy to Help You Quit Tobacco, 2021).</strong>  <br>
                  
                  Depending on the body size and smoking habits of a person, most people should start using a patch that is full-strength then slowly change to a weaker patch. The patch must be changed every day. It should be placed below the neck or above the waist, either upper arm or chest in a clean dry area of the skin without hairs. The FDA approved of using patches for 3 to 5 months, however, if it exceeds, it may lead back to the actual use of cigarettes or tobacco <strong>(Nicotine Replacement Therapy to Help You Quit Tobacco, 2021).</strong> <br>
                  If the patient has pregnancy related nausea and vomiting, then patches may be a better solution <strong>(Stop smoking in pregnancy, 2019). </strong><br><br>
                   Possible side effects include: <br>
                  ●	Skin irritation (redness and itching) <br>
                  ●	Dizziness <br>
                  ●	racing heartbeat <br>
                  ●	sleeping problems or unusual dreams <br>
                  ●	headache & nause <br>
                  ●	muscle aches and stiffness <br>

                    <img src="assets/images/SMOKING/TREATMENT _ MANAGEMENT/3.jpg" alt="" />
                  </div>
                  <p> Nicotine gum can be bought without a prescription from the doctor. It is a fast-acting form of replacement and can be taken orally through the mucous membrane of the mouth. It comes in 2 and 4 mg strengths <strong>(Nicotine Replacement Therapy to Help You Quit Tobacco, 2021).</strong>
                    <br>
                  How to use nicotine gum: <br>
                  The instructions must be followed when using nicotine gum. Be reminded that nicotine gum is not like regular gum, it is chewed slowly until the taste gets peppery or tingly, then you will tuck it beside your cheek until the taste fades. Then repeat it. Do this for 20 to 30 minutes. If you are about to eat or drink, do it at least 15 minutes before as well as during gum use. This is recommended with a maximum of 6 months. <br><br>
                   Possible side effects include: <br>
                  ●	 Bad taste <br>
                  ●	Throat irritation <br>
                  ●	 Mouth sores <br>
                  ●	 Hiccups and nausea <br>
                  ●	Jaw discomfort <br>
                  ●	Racing heartbeat <br>
                  <br><br>
                  3.	NICOTINE NASAL SPRAY <br></p>

                    <img src="assets/images/SMOKING/TREATMENT _ MANAGEMENT/5.jpg" alt="" />
                  </div>
                  <p> Nicotine nasal spray is only available via prescription. Before using this, consult first with the attending physician. These nasal sprays deliver nicotine to the bloodstream rapidly and absorb it through the patient’s nose <strong>(Nicotine Replacement Therapy to Help You Quit Smoking, 2021).</strong>
                  <br>
                  How to use nicotine nasal spray: <br>
                  These nasal spray must be used directed by your healthcare provider. Most people use 1 to 2 doses per hour and at least 8 doses or 16 sprays each day. This must not be use more than 40 doses or 80 sprays <strong>(Nicotine Replacement Therapy to Help You Quit Smoking, 2021).</strong> <br><br>
                   Possible side effects include: <br>
                  ●	nasal irritation <br>
                  ●	runny nose <br>
                  ●	watery eyes and sneezing <br>
                  ●	throat irritation and coughing <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>

                  </div>
                  <p>Nicotine inhalers are only available via prescription. It is placed in a thin plastic tube with a nicotine cartridge inside. This easily delivers to the lungs and can also be delivered through vapor to the mouth and throat where it is absorbed into the bloodstream <strong>(Nicotine Replacement Therapy to Help You Quit Smoking, 2021).</strong> <br>
                  How to use nicotine inhaler: <br>
                  The nicotine inhaler will be puff on and the cartridge will send a pure nicotine vapor into the mouth. It can be used for about 20 minutes or you can puff it only a few minutes at a time. The recommended dose for the use of this is between 4 and 20 cartridges a day and slowly tapering off over 6 months. <br><br>
                   Possible side effects include: <br>
                  ●	Coughing <br>
                  ●	mouth and/or throat irritation <br>
                  ●	 runny nose <br>
                  ●	upset stomach <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  5.	NICOTINE LOZENGES <br> </p>
                  <div class="left-image">
                    <img src="assets/images/SMOKING/TREATMENT _ MANAGEMENT/6.jpg" alt="" />
                  </div>
                  <p> Nicotine lozenges can be bought without a prescription but consult first with the attending physician. It is available in 2 and 4 mg. The required dose should be determined by how long a person regularly smokes their first cigarette after waking up. Use 4 mg nicotine lozenges if you smoke your first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up. Use 2 mg-nicotine lozenges if you smoke your first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up. Some people who use NRT prefer lozenges to gum because they are less noticeable <strong>(Nicotine Replacement Therapy to Help You Quit Smoking, 2021).</strong> <br><br>
                  How to use nicotine lozenges: <br>
                  Do not drink for at least 15 minutes before or while using lozenge. Do not use more than 1 lozenge. Suck on the mint lozenge until it is fully dissolved for about 20 to 30 minutes. Do not chew and swallow it, leave it in your cheeks. Stop using this after 12 weeks, if you feel the need, consult with your doctor <strong>(Nicotine Replacement Therapy to Help You Quit Smoking, 2021). </strong><br><br>
