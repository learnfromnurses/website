              <h4>WHAT IS <em>CAFFEINE?</em></h4>
              <p>
                Caffeine is a naturally occurring stimulant that is extensively taken across the globe. It helps you remain alert and may help you avoid feeling fatigued (Lieberman et. al., 1987).  
                <br />
                <br />
                HOW IT WORKS?
                <br />
                Caffeine works by activating the central nervous  system, the heart, the muscles, and the blood  pressure-regulating regions. Caffeine can elevate blood pressure but may not do so in chronic caffeine users. Caffeine can also function as a diuretic, increasing urine output. Caffeine is most frequently used for mental alertness, headaches, migraines, athletic performance, memory, and weight loss. Additionally, it is used to treat asthma, gallbladder disease, ADHD, hypotension, and depression, among  other diseases (Grosso, 2017).

                    According to coffee consumption statistics, between  30%-40% of the world's population consumes coffee daily (Hudyakova, 2020).

                    Individuals who require a great deal of mental, creative, and intellectual work are literally compelled to stimulate themselves with coffee, which is OK provided you can manage your daily coffee consumption and are aware of your own boundaries. In this situation, productivity does really rise, and there is no harm to health. These employees frequently consume coffee throughout the day and  even after work (Hudyakova, 2020).

                BENEFITS OF 
                <em> CAFFEINE</em></h4>
              <p>  
                Caffeine does have some advantageous characteristics. It aids in the reduction of weariness and enhances attention. It enhances athletic performance, especially in endurance sports. It is particularly efficient in relieving tension headaches when used with ibuprofen (Advil). It is high in antioxidants, which help prevent or reduce cell damage and may help protect against heart disease and diabetes. Coffee  consumers are less likely to get gallstones. It protects males  from Parkinson's disease (Morris, 2018).

                  SOURCES OF 
                  <em> CAFFEINE</em></h4>
                <p>  
                    Caffeine occurs naturally in coffee, cocoa, and guarana  plants' fruit, leaves, and beans. Additionally, it is added to  drinks and dietary supplements. There is a danger of overconsumption of caffeinated beverages such as soda and energy drinks since they are cooled and easily digested in large quantities. 
                    <br> <br>
                    1.	GUARA <br>
                This is an extract of a seed from a South American plant that is used in cuisines, energy drinks, and supplements. Guarana seeds contain about four times the caffeine contained in coffee beans (Maustakas et. al., 2015). Certain beverages using these seeds' extracts may contain up to 125 mg of caffeine per serving.
                <br><br>
                2.	COFFEE <br>
                Caffeine content in 1 cup or 8 ounces of brewed coffee is around 95 mg. Approximately 60 mg caffeine is included in the same quantity of instant coffee. Caffeine content in decaffeinated coffee is around 4 mg (Satel, 2006).  
                <br><br>
                3.	ESPRESSO <br>
                    Caffeine content per shot or 1.5 ounces is around 65 mg (Klein, 2015). 
                <br><br>
                4.	TEA <br>
                A cup of black tea has around 47 milligrams of caffeine. Green tea has a caffeine content of around 28 mg. The caffeine content of decaffeinated tea is 2 mg, whereas herbal tea has none (Drewnowski et. al., 2016). 
                <br><br>
                5.	ENERGY DRINK <br>
                A cup of black tea has around 47 milligrams of caffeine. Green tea has a caffeine content of around 28 mg. The caffeine content of decaffeinated tea is 2 mg, whereas herbal tea has none (Klein, 2015).  
                <br><br>
                6.	SODA <br>
                    Caffeine content in a 12-ounce can of normal or diet dark cola is around 40 mg. Mountain Dew has the equivalent of 55 mg caffeine (Drewnowski et. al., 2016). 
                <br><br>
                7.	CHOCOLATE (COCOA) <br>
                Dark chocolate has around 24  mg of caffeine per ounce, whereas milk chocolate contains  roughly a fourth of that amount (Drewnowski et. al., 2016).  
                <br><br>
                8.	SUPPLEMENTS <br>
                Caffeine supplements typically include  200 mg of caffeine each pill, or the equivalent of two cups  of brewed coffee (Drewnowski et. al., 2016).

              <h4>COMMON SIDE EFFECTS OF<em> CAFFEINE TO OUR BODY</em></h4>
              <p>
                Caffeine is quickly absorbed by the body, with effects appearing five to thirty minutes after administration. These effects may include increased breathing, heart rate, mental sharpness, and physical energy. These effects might last up to 12 hours depending on the individual (Hartney, 2021).  Caffeine overdose symptoms and indicators include the following: <br> <br>
                ●	 Restlessness <br>
                ●	Nervousness <br>
                ●	 Excitement <br>
                ●	Insomnia <br>
                ●	Increased body temperature <br>
                ●	 Flushed Face <br>
                ●	 Urination that is excessive <br>
                ●	Disturbances of the gastrointestinal tract <br>
                ●	Twitching of muscles <br>
                ●	Speech that rambles  <br>
                ●	Tachycardia or arrhythmia cardiac <br>
                ●	Inexhaustible periods <br>
                ●	Difficulty relaxing <br>

              <h4>IS CAFFEINE              
                <em> ADDICTIVE?</em></h4>
              <p>  
                When compared to illicit substances or alcohol, caffeine does not generate the same degree of withdrawal symptoms or dangerous drug-seeking behavior. Therefore, caffeine dependency is not considered an addiction by medical professionals (Stuart, 2021).

                <h4>SIGN OF             
                  <em> TOXICITY</em></h4>
                <p>  
                    Caffeine toxicity has been seen in individuals who consume 1.2 grams or more of caffeine in a single dosage. It is claimed that consuming between 10 and 14 grams at a time is lethal. Convulsions and vomiting have been reported after caffeine ingestion of up to 10 grams, however recovery is achievable in around 6 hours. Restlessness, irritability, anxiety, vomiting, high heart rate, and tremors are all common side effects at smaller dosages of 1 gram or less of the drug excess  (Harpaz et. al., 2017). 
                    <br>
                    The use of caffeinated drinks does not usually result in toxicity since a very big volume would need to be consumed over a short period of time to reach a dangerous level (10 gm of caffeine is equal to about 100 cups of brewed coffee). Caffeine pills or tablets are more often associated with dangerous blood levels when taken in excess (Harpaz et. al.,2017).

                <p>
                    Caffeine's interactions with other pharmaceuticals including over the counter and prescription medications – may be unpredictable and harmful, and may result in the following: <br>
                    Caffeine + alcohol puts the body under pressure and can disguise alcohol's sedative effects such as sleepiness, resulting in greater drinking, risky behavior, and higher alcohol-related problems. Caffeine in combination with  other psychoactive substances may enhance the effects of  other psychoactive drugs. Additionally, it may interfere with  over the counter and prescription drugs (Kaye, 2014).

                              ● INCREASE BLOOD PRESSURE <br />
                              Higher caffeine intake during pregnancy seems to be associated with elevated systolic blood pressure levels in the first and third trimester, but not with diastolic blood pressure levels (Bakker et al., 2011). For over 40 years (1970–2010), the prevalence of chronic hypertension was 0.63%, with over a 2-fold higher rate among black (1.24%) than white (0.53%) women (Ananth et al., 2019).  <br><br>
                              ● INCREASE HEART RATE <br>                             
                              As your heart beats faster it accelerates about three beats per minute and your blood flow speeds up, too. The increase in your heart rate from caffeine can take effect in as soon as 15 minutes and take approximately six hours to wear off (Advent Health, 2021). Our results suggest that maternal intake of both caffeine and 70% cocoa have a stimulating action on fetal reactivity. This finding is likely due to the pharmacological action of theobromine, a methylxanthine present in coffee and in chocolate (Buscicchio et al., 2012).
                              <br><br>
                              ● INCREASES FREQUENCY OF URINATION <br>                          
                              Caffeinated beverages which act as natural diuretics and doctors often recommend reducing caffeine intake to avoid potential pregnancy complications (Nall, 2016). Caffeine at 4.5 mg/kg caused diuresis and decreased the threshold of sensation at filling phase, with an increase in flow rate and voided volume. So, caffeine can promote early urgency and frequency of urination. Individuals with lower urinary tract symptoms should avoid or be cautious in consuming caffeine containing foodstuffs (Lohsiriwat et al., 2011).
                              <br><br>
                              ● MISCARRIAGES <br>
                              Too much caffeine can cause miscarriage (when a baby dies in the womb before 20 weeks of pregnancy) (March of Dimes, 2020). The researchers saw a reduction in miscarriage risk for women who took a daily multivitamin and in addition, women who continued to take the vitamins through early pregnancy with a risk reduction of 79 percent. (NIH, 2016).

                              ● PRE-TERM<br />
                              It turns out that a daily dose of caffeine in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) also helps premature babies born under 29 weeks get the best possible start to life (Veriotes, 2019). Preterm birth is when a baby is born too early, before 37 weeks of pregnancy have been completed. In 2020, preterm birth affected 1 of every 10 infants born in the United States. 
                              <br><br>
                              ● IRRITABILITY AND TROUBLE WITH SLEEPING <br />
                              Caffeine passes into breast milk and it suggests that you limit how much you have. Babies that are breastfed should also be watched for irritability and trouble with sleeping (Mother to Baby, 2021). Caffeine’s main effect is making people feel more awake for a short time and large amounts of caffeine could affect babies in the same way as it does adults. Some reports suggest that children born to mothers who consumed more than 500mg/day in the third trimester were more likely to have faster heart rates, shaking, increased breathing rate, and spend more time awake in the days following birth. (Mother to Baby, 2021).

                              ● HYPERACTIVITY <br />                        
                              Hyperactivity is a state of being unusually or abnormally active and often a symptom of an underlying mental or physical health condition. One of the main conditions associated with hyperactivity is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Gill & Goodwin, 2019). About 6.1 million children in the United States (9.4 percent) between ages 2 to 17 are estimated to have been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD or ADD) (Saline, 2022).

                            <h4>TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT</h4>
                            <p>
                                According to Wierzejska et al (2019), caffeine is a common component that is being used among liquid products like tea, soda, and coffee. These are also being widely consumed by pregnant women. Although limited intake of caffeine is considered safe and may even have health benefits, many mothers still have worries about its safety even during breastfeeding.<br>
                                According to Meixner (2018), the ACOG recommends limiting the intake of caffeine to 200mg or less if the patient is expecting or trying to become pregnant. With this, below are the following recommendations for treatment and management of caffeine consumption during pregnancy.<br>
                              <br>
                            1.	Limit caffeine intake by 200mg or less. <br>
                            2.	Consider the source or the brand of the liquid drink. <br>
                            3.	Avoid drinking energy drinks for the entire duration of pregnancy. These energy drinks contain high amounts of artificial sweeteners and sugars, hence, they lack nutritional value for pregnant women. Aside from this, energy drinks contain different kinds of herbs like ginseng which are not safe for pregnant women. <br>
                            4.	Avoid drinking certain herbal teas during pregnancy including those teas that has chicory root, licorice root, or fenugreek. <br>
                            5.	Instead, drink caffeine-free beverages like water, decaf coffee, and safe caffeine-free teas. <br>
                            <br>    
                            However, according to Ahmed (2017), the following herbal teas have been reported as safe to drink during pregnancy: <br>
                            ●	 ginger root <br>
                            ●	peppermint leaf <br>
                            ●	red raspberry leaf – limiting intake to 1 cup or 240mL per day during the first trimester <br>
                            ●	lemon balm <br>
                            Above all, it is important to consult first with your doctor before taking or drinking any liquid beverages.
